I downloaded my dataset from kaggle . I use the cornel dialogue corpus dataset
The corpus contains:

movie_titles_metadata.txt
movie_characters_metadata.txt
movie_lines.txt
movie_conversations.txt
For this project I choose movie_conversations.txt and movie_lines.txt.

In all files the field separator is " +++$+++ "

movie_lines.txt - contains the actual text of each utterance

fields:
lineID
characterID (who uttered this phrase)
movieID
character name
text of the utterance
movie_conversations.txt - the structure of the conversations

fields
characterID of the first character involved in the conversation
characterID of the second character involved in the conversation
movieID of the movie in which the conversation occurred
I also downloaded a glove dataset to perform glove embedding.
